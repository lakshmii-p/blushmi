# 💖 Blushmi – A Beautiful Shopping Experience for Women

Blushmi is a frontend shopping website inspired by the elegant aesthetic and user-first design of @Nykaa.  
It showcases a curated range of **dresses**, **makeup**, **skincare**, and **footwear** products — designed exclusively for women.

This project is a result of my pure passion for web development, design, and solving real-world UI challenges.  
I imagined, designed, and built it entirely by myself — facing and resolving multiple frontend issues along the way.

## 🌸 Why "Blushmi"?

The name **Blushmi** is a unique blend of:
- **Blush** – representing femininity, glow, and beauty.
- **Lakshmi** – my own name, standing for creativity, value, and identity.

Blushmi isn't just a brand concept — it's a reflection of me.
